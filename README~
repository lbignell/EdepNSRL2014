-This file was copied from my original simulation, quenched-Edep-spec, which
 was focussed on examining the differences between quenching per interaction
 and quenching per event.
-This simulation will simply look at the energy deposited in the vials for the
 proposed NSRL beamline expt setup.
DetectorConstr:
-A simple vial, followed by 20 x 20 x Z cm of HDPE (z is adjustable), followed
 by another vial directly behind the first. This can later be extended to an
 array of vials. I should investigate whether it'll be easier to make the
 generation of the existing vial geometry into some sort of function so that I
 can simply place another 'vial' ~Z cm away from the first vial.
PGA:
-Beam will be uniformly incident over the vial area.
PhysList:
-G4 low energy. I should update the existing one.
SD:
-Shouldn't actually change too much, I still want the Edep in the vial. I will
 give it the once-over to ensure that it is correct for this application.
RA:
-Same as SD, just needs a once-over to ensure it'll be correct.
DetectorMessenger:
-I want to be able to adjust the thickness of the attenuation layer, which
 means that I need to adjust the location of the entire second vial.

-DC has been modified so that it is just the vial.
-PGA is working correctly, AFAIK.
-PhysicsList has been upgraded. I've reappropriated the example physics list
 from the advanced/Hadrontherapy example as my physics list.
-Commented out most of the irrelevant sections in SensitiveDetector
-Also commented out irrelevant sections of RunAction

4/2/14
-Back to it, as COWBELLS isn't working, and I've figured out how to do cmake.
-Still need to modify DetectorConstruction, add second SensitiveDetector as the
 second vial, update RunAction accordingly, and develop DetectorMessenger to
 adjust the PET thickness/density.

-Modified DetectorConstruction so that it now resembles the NSRL geometry.
-But... The range of protons is clearly discrepant with the SRIM/PSTAR calcs!
-->Range requires ~160 mm of HDPE, rather than ~233 mm.
-->I've simplified the physics list, checked the material definition and density
   as well as the particle energy; no joy :-S

4/7/14
-As far as I can see there is nothing wrong with the physics list (I can't
 attribute it to a 'bad choice' of physics either, it just doesn't make much
 difference when I change the physics models).
-There's also nothing wrong with the detector construction either, as far as I
 can tell. (The dimensions are correct, I've added a 1mm gap between vial and
 HDPE block to ensure volumes aren't overlapping).
-In case I forget again, the command to cmake the program is:

cmake -DGeant4_DIR=/usr/local/geant4.10.00/lib64/Geant4-10.0.0/ /home/local1/EdepNSRL2014/

-Well, I'm stumped. I think the only thing to do now is to make the HDPE
 absorber a sensitive detector and start probing the material properties,
 physics, etc.

4/8/14
-Actually, before I do the above, I'll transfer this code over to my other
 Geant4 machine, and see if it runs on an earlier version.
-->Well that didn't work.
-I've updated my physics; now rather than using a G4VUserPhysicsList-derived 
 derived class, I'm using a 'physics factory'. This ensures that the Physics is
 all completely correct (or at least not completely stuffed).
-->No effect.
-I can't see anything wrong with my DetectorConstruction.cc file, but just to be
 sure I used the pre-defined materials based on the NIST database.
-->Et Voila! The range now appears to be correct. I don't know why... but it
   does. Perhaps there is a problem with the way I was defining the density of 
   HDPE (it would have to be the units), or perhaps it has to do with the mean
   ionisation energy (the only other difference)?

To do:
- Create a DetectorMessenger class to handle changing the absorber thickness.
- Add more vials (I guess I could also make them sensitive detectors).
- Look at the effect of adding a shaping material to flatten out the dose.

4/14/14
- I've run for various thicknesses of HDPE, but there is some wierdness.
- Firstly, there is a peak at low energies --> Gammas scattering in?
- Secondly, the dose in back/front is quite a bit lower than the SRIM calc. Why?
- Thirdly, there is some structure at the higher energies of the Edep spectrum 
  in the rear vial. I don't know why.

Things to do:
- Gate the vial Edep by process and parent particle, etc. (so that in ROOT I can
  identify how the Edep occurred).
- Make the HDPE into a sensitive detector and get similar info to the vials.
- Get the number (and energy spectrum) of protons that leave the world volume.
- Turn on/off various processes to estimate their effects.
- Add more vials at the front/back.

4/15/14
- I've added the capability to look at the Kin En of the incident particle as it
  enters the vial, the Edep caused by that particle, the particle type, the path
  length of that particle prior to entry, and the path length within the vial.
- It appears that:
  - When you break down the energy deposit by type of particle, most of it comes
    from the primary proton. The feature at low energies is predominantly due to
    electrons.
  - There is some peculiar structure when you plot Edep vs Kinetic Energy of
    incident particles. There is a line associated with whole energy deposit,
    and there is a curve structure that limits the incident kinetic energy. I 
    suspect that this is a geometry-dependent effect, so I am adding another two
    vials to the front (one below and one to the side, to simulate a corner).
  - dE/dX vs incident kinetic energy actually follows what I would expect (a
    good thing too, otherwise there may be a physics problem).
  - There is a distinct double-peaked structure in the distribution of the
    kinetic energy of incident protons. Geometry?

4/16/14
- Geometry: beam = +y, vertical up = +z.
- Adding new vials below and next to existing vial. There will be a 10 mm gap
  between the top of the vial underneath and the bottom of the front vial. There
  will be a 5 mm gap between the vial next to the front vial.
- Offset for underneath vial = 72.27 mm.
- Offset for side vial = 5 mm + 2*(vial outer radius)

- After discussion with David:
  - I need to modify the liquid volume to 15 mL.
  - I should also log the vertex position of the incident particles (so I can
    see shadows from front vials, etc.)
  - I should plot Edep in rear vial as a function of Edep in front vial.

- All done.

4/17/14
- Interestingly, when you compare the incident particle kinetic energy for
  protons that deposited energy in the front vial with those that didn't, the
  source of the two-population distribution becomes apparent. The higher KE
  protons come from the particles that miss the front vial and are deflected to 
  the rear vial.
  --> If this is the case, shouldn't the effect be more pronounced when there
      are no vials adjacent to the front vial? Testing this...
      - There may have been a difference, but it wasn't obviously significant.

- Adding the 'flattener' at the front to try and fix this effect...
  --> The flattener changes the dose profile, so that the dose received by the
      vials is higher and the second population decreases. The rear/front dose
      increases to ~2.8 from 2.4. Results look good for now.
      Going to run overnight to get better statistics.

6/4/14
- Flattener dimensions (for ref)
  - Vial outer radius = 13.77 mm ~ 14 mm.
  - Flattener thickness = 2*(13.77 + 5)mm = 37.54 mm.
  - Flattener hole radius = 13.77 + 1 mm = 14.77 mm.

8/27/14
- It turns out that NSRL has an absorber thickness of 21.5 cm, not 23.3 cm.
  -> I'm running a scan over the energies to maximise the energy deposit in the
     rear vial.

- I've also modified the flattener thickness, the hole thicknesses within the 
  flattener, and added a rear flattener to make the simulation more realistic.

- Based on the new simulation, it appears that we need a beam energy of 201 MeV
  for a maximal dose ratio.
